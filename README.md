<hr>


The aim of this project is to predict the maintenance of railway tracks using signal processing techniques. The data used in this project is from Metro Valencia, a Spanish railway company. The data consists of the vibration signals of the railway tracks. The data is collected from the sensors placed on the locomotives to monitor the condition of the railway tracks.

# Files

The main files of the project are:
1. `src/utils.py`: Utility functions.
2. `src/logs.py`: Logging functions.
3. `src/anomaly_detection/isolation_forest.py`: Isolation forest model.
4. `src/anomaly_detection/time_series.py`: Time series model.
5. `configs/app_config.yml`: Configuration file for the project.
